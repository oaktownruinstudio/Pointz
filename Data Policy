Privacy Policy – PointZ
Last updated: January 5, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how OakTownRuinStudio (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles information when you use PointZ (the “App”).

1) Who we are (Data Controller)

OakTownRuinStudio
79110 Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany
Support email: oaktownruinstudio@gmail.com

2) Summary (short version)

No account required.

No selling of data.

The App is designed to work offline and does not transmit your game data to us.

If you choose to set avatar images, the App accesses only the images you select to display them in the UI.

3) Information you provide in the App

The App lets you enter and manage game-related information such as:

player names

game name

scores/round entries

game rules/settings (e.g., scoring mode)

This information is used only to run the scoring and statistics features inside the App.

4) Photos / Avatar images (optional)

If you choose to add an avatar, the App will access the image(s) you select only for the purpose of displaying the avatar in the App.

The App does not scan your photo library.

The App does not upload your selected images to us.

5) Data we collect automatically

We do not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, or similar tracking data from within the App.

Your device’s operating system and app store provider (e.g., Google Play) may process certain data independently (for example, for downloads, updates, security, or crash diagnostics). This processing is controlled by those providers under their own privacy policies.

6) How we use information

We use information only to:

provide the App’s core features (game setup, scoring, round history, statistics)

display optional avatars you choose

7) Sharing of information

We do not share your in-app game data with third parties, because we do not receive it.

8) Data storage, retention, and deletion

Game-related information and optional avatars are intended to be used locally on your device.

You can delete data by:

deleting games inside the App (where available), and/or

clearing the App’s storage in your Android device settings, and/or

uninstalling the App

If Android device backup is enabled on your phone, some app data may be included in your device backups depending on your system settings.

9) Security

We take reasonable measures to protect information processed within the App. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

10) Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

11) Your privacy rights (EEA/UK – GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, restriction, objection, and data portability.
